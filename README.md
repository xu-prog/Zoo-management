# Zoo-management

models a simple zoo using object-oriented programming principles. 
The project defines various animal types, their behaviors, and interactions, leveraging inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding to represent realistic animal behaviors. 
The simulation demonstrates how different animals, such as Eagles, Lions, Tigers, Wolves, and Penguins, interact in a zoo environment.
